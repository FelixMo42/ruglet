2.4.B – SEND
Screens were built into the pillars and architecture  that framed the steps in front of the Columbus Theatre, and drew on nearby onboards for footage, framing everything in vertical slices.  They tried to avoid capturing images of the security presence, instead focusing on people, fashion, and style, but it wasn’t always successful.  As they approached Mechard, the servers pulled from the footage of what A saw, slowed down to be more cinematic, as opposed to gaze darting around.  They then switched to what Mechard saw, and then someone else’s view, as the two drew nearer, to show them meeting.
“I’m nervous.”
[Trust.  Mechard isn’t unkind.]
“A, too long,” Mechard greeted A, while approaching.
“Too long,” A responded.  She paused as she approached her friend, “I’m not sure how to hug you.”
Mechard had never dropped his penchant for picking the most extreme and often inconvenient mods, was currently a hairless head and torso mounted in a U-shaped frame, with hard rods running from frame to multiple points on the body.  Arms and legs were mounted on the outside of the ‘U’.  A silky fabric swaddled the torso, and draped from the groin area of the ‘U’, black, with motifs in white that matched the decorative elements in the metal.
[Architectural,] Basil supplied, when he noted A glancing over it all, a hand half raised, showing how unsure she was.
Mechard reached for her arms and guided her a hug, just for the torso.  The arms folded around A, hands on her shoulder and back.
“Sorry we lost touch,” A said.  “Thanks for answering.”
“It’s fine.  We were…” Mechard took a second to consider, while breaking the hug.  “…A few years apart.  You guys invited me to hear your band.  You were never unkind.”
A gave Mechard a half-smile.
The footage turned its focus to the arrival of others.  Four members of Generation Zodiac arriving as a group.
Mechard murmured, “I’m so sorry about Vince, Nos, and Cowrie.  I only really knew Vince, but…”
A nodded, quickly.
“…I’d met Nos and Cowrie.  Nobody deserved that.”
“You look good,” she told him.
“Then I must have screwed something up,” he said, smiling a bit.  “You’re a bit intimidating.  I’ve never seen security like there is here, or people testing it so hard.  You look at me and twelve billion people see me.”
“They don’t bite.  Or they shouldn’t, anyway.”
Mechard’s smile pulled upward at one side. “Looking after her, Bas?”
[Trying.]
[gret]
[Hello, dog,] Basil replied to Mechard’s onboard.
[gret is great and greet]
[Okay, dog.  It also grates.]
[e after t?]
[Grates does have an e after the t.]
[ok yeh]
Mechard smiled more.  “Shall we?”
A fleet of tenures flew past, fifteen meters overhead, stirring up some wind.  A put a hand to her hair.
[It’s fine.]
“Okay, thanks.”
He could sense her starting to vocalize something, on that level where he’d blocked all the base onboard’s level of sensation, but kept it for the back channel.
She didn’t start or finish what she planned to say.
A wore a white jacket and white dress, and had her hair in a waterfall braid.  Basil had nanotech chains running down locks of hair, so he could help it settle in a way that looked good.  Wind blew a bit of hair across her shoulder, and he was able to let it slide off instead of piling up there and needing a hand to sweep it back into a proper place.
Merchard touched her arm.  “Shall we?”
A nodded.  She walked up the wide stone steps, one hand on Mechard’s arm, and they passed the threshold of screens and walls of varying heights showing other attendees and distance shots of the venue with the night sky behind it.  As they walked up the long set of stairs with the band of dark blue carpet running down the center, there were less and less screens.  Just pillars with screens, then pillars without.  The Theatre was nearly a thousand years old, stone, brought up from its original location, situated here, and surrounded by complementary buildings and architecture, miming the original style.  Many places around the wider block leveraged a similar aesthetic.  Expensive, but many places on Earth were, especially those close to historic locations.
The tan stone facade was stately, but the windows reflected the alternating darkness of night sky and the light of passing Tenures and drones, or advertisements on distant screens.  Dark, stark, and sharp in their reflection of modernity.
[Welcome to high society, A.]
“Welcome indeed.  I’ve never done anything like this,” A said.
“Do you think I have?” Mechard asked.
“I’m just glad to have a more familiar face around.  Thank you for coming.”
“Of course,” Mechard said.  “Your parents are coming too.”
“They are.  It’ll be nice, they’ve been away.”
They entered the front doors, where there were guards on either side.  Some agreement had been made to keep this space sacrosanct, so the technology and screens of further outside more or less ceased to be, here, and there was only a passive connection to the wider Belt network, with all systems disguised or tucked away.  The interior had gilded columns and framing around windows, arching ceilings with stained glass at the highest points, wide stairs leading up to higher levels, and crowds of people.
“It makes me think of the science center,” A said.
[Will you be all right?]
A nodded.
Basil could sense the tension in her body.  He eased it where he could.
“Aren’t you a striking figure,” someone said, eyeing Mechard.  They were Aire June, a child of a ship manufacturing family, and they wore a modern suit, with very trim lapels and details, and had a long black ponytail that went nearly to the back of their knees.  “Aren’t you uncomfortable?  Hello, A.  Such a pleasure to have you.”
“The pleasure’s mine,’ A said.  “This is my friend of a few years and my plus-one, Mechard.  Introductions feel strange when everyone has an onboard, don’t they?  The information is available.”
“They do,” Aire agreed.  “The language and how we socialize will limp a step behind until we adjust.  It will be interesting to see where we take this thing you have helped bring about.”
“I have a feeling,” Aire’s partner, Mser June mused aloud, “That it’s but one ripple that will extend out from A.  Our children may even laugh at the idea that promotion of onboards alone was thought to be A’s mark on culture.  For example… Mechard.  Is this going to be a new subculture?  Common practice?  Do you mind if we admire?”
“You may admire, but I’m not sure I’m admirable,” Mechard said
A few others took notice, as well, or they’d noticed before, and now felt they could approach and indulge their curiosity.
“This is comfortable compared to some of my prior setups.”
“You turn yourself into walking art?”
“That’s a side effect of my real intention.  I try to keep myself on my toes.”
[dog toe]
“Even with my onboard,” Mechard added, as some of the people reacted with confusion.
A smiled lightly, watching as Mechard got attention.
“A,” a man said.  He was thicker in build, face and body rounded, but there was a firmness to how he was built that suggested it was intentional, his onboard helping to cement the physique and turning it into something else behind the scenes.  An engine of physicality.
[Conaway Brothers, Brothers is his last name and his business name.  He’s in movies and television.  Pretend you remember his name.]
“Mr. Brothers,” A greeted the man.
He smiled, apparently pleased to be recognized.
“How do I know him?” A asked, by backchannel.
[Red mentioned him in passing.  I pulled up his face briefly.  I advise you don’t bring up that specific mention.  Let people connect the dots.]
“I wasn’t going to bring it up.”
“I was hoping to borrow your ear tonight, and I seem to have run into you before anyone else built up the courage.  Maybe I’m brave, maybe I’m dumb.  I’ve been told both.”
“I’m not that scary.”
“As a member of Generation Colors, you have some leeway in deciding what projects to pursue.  You may have to run this by other members of your group, but I thought we might have a choice opportunity here.”
“I’m very new to all of this, I’m worried I”ll say the wrong thing and get chewed out later, for agreeing to something and putting Generation Colors or Elabre Systems in a bind.”
“Nothing binding.  What do the words Coordinated Canon mean to you?”
“Basilisk?”
[It’s fine, it’d be weirder if you knew.]
“I- it sounds familiar, but I’m not sure.  Refresh me?”
“It was a thing in prior generations, but fell out of favor.  The question a man like me must ask every single day, is what can we sell, in media, that others can’t have an Intelligence spin up for themselves?  One way to go about it is to focus on the ‘themselves’ part of that.  A story you spin up is yours, individual.”
“Right.”
“A story that everyone is on the same page about is different.  Movies, media, games, merchandise, all defining a unified genre, story, and directorial vision, to build something made for your generation.  In the past, it disintegrated due to a lack of investment from audiences.  But now we have a secret ingredient.”
[You.]
“Me?” A asked.
“You.  If you’re key to it, people will care.  We can build a series of interconnected properties and stories, and paint a picture that people can anticipate, talk about with each other…”
[You watched some films in a Coordinated Canon when you were young, A,] Basil pointed out, messaging Brothers the same, because there were no speakers nearby to speak through.  He supplied some images to refresh A’s memory.
“But I didn’t know they were coordinated canon,” A said.
[You didn’t.]
“It’s a different experience when it’s live,” Brothers said.  “If it’s done well.  I think we can do something grand.  Think about it, talk about it with friends, colleagues.”
He extended a hand a bit past A, prompting A to turn around.  Some of Generation Colors had come in the door.
Amber made a beeline right for them.  “I think it’s an interesting idea.  I caught the tail end as a child.  I think I liked it more than most.”
“You did,” Brothers said, raising an index finger, giving it a shake toward her.  “I remember looking, about a year ago, when I was considering the idea.  You and one of the others.  My onboard is telling me it was Blue.”
“Yes, he and I have talked about it, too.”
“Unfortunately, we couldn’t envision getting the traction and investment we could get now.  Perhaps you and Green could sell A on the idea?”
“I’d love to try.”
“I’ll leave it in your hands, then.  Schedule a meeting with me if you want to talk about it in more depth.  If I don’t hear from you, I’ll still try to run it by Elabre as a project.  I’ll leave you be.”
“It’s good to see you, Mr. Brothers,” Amber said.
“Nice to meet you,” A echoed.
“Both of you, as well.”
He left to go mingle with peers.  A hung back, watching Mechard, who had been pulled away by a group.  People were admiring Mechard’s look and discussing mods with Mechard, who knew a lot about the history and variety.
“I’m hoping I wasn’t doing anything wrong.  I’m new to this,” A told Amber.
“You’re fine.  Brothers was more forward than most, but he’s usually like that.  Putting a bug in your ear, and in the ear of the one point two billion people who are watching through your eyes right now,” Amber said, winking as she made brief eye contact with A, as if to acknowledge that audience.  “We can talk about the movies and universe on a quieter day, if you show up early for the training again.”
“That would be great.”
Jan, dressed in her characteristic yellow, lingered nearby.  They wore a sleeveless top in gold with a thick collar, almost a halter top, and had wavy brown hair tied back into a ponytail.  They perked up and walked over to Amber, bending over and setting chin down on Amber’s bare shoulder, because of the height difference, “So cute.”
The ‘cute’ ones were the next generation down.  Each Generation of company-organized celebrities had its own age ranges, so at worst, a given person had some of the youngest members of one generation and the oldest of the next to look up to.  All picked with strategy and Intelligences mapping out permutations and possibilities.  The next group down ranged from fourteen to about ten.  Generation Zodiac.
“Dragon brought Lo from Sindar Media as his plus one.  They’re holding hands,” Jan observed.
“Twenty-four kids, wide-eyed, trying their hardest,” Amber murmured.  “Just getting this far was such a big deal.  Being told yes, you can dance, but now we want you to learn to act.  Learn in two weeks.  Done?  Now learn a new instrument.  Can you do that?  Can you be everything?”
She gave that last word a special sort of emphasis, murmur becoming a whisper.
A nodded.
“Then if you can genuinely say yes, yes, you can act, you can sing, you can play instruments, you can market yourself… you can switch from doing one one day to doing another the next, your scout gets you to the audition stage.  Then they decide, are you the right piece in the puzzle they’re putting together?  Are there possible dynamics?  Do you fill a niche?  Or are you too similar in appearance to a kid who is half a percentage point better than you?  You could fill swimming pools with the collected tears of kids who didn’t make it because of factors like that that they couldn’t control.  Kids who weren’t even ten years old.”
[I wonder how that affects you, that sort of struggle in formative years.  Does it shape the person you become?]
“No doubt, Bas,” Amber said.  “Win or lose.  I think about those kids a lot, the ones I saw glimpses of in auditions.”
Jan, still hunched over with chin resting on Amber’s shoulder, hugged Amber from behind.
“Then you have a group of thirty or so.  Twenty-four kids in Generation Zodiac.  In five years, there might be sixteen, with some finding niches.  Some dropping out.  By the time they’re our parents’ ages, there will be six to eight left and going strong, part of that pool of big-name adult celebrities, joining the five to six from Sindar and the three or four from Madali Group, and so on.  Makes me wistful, seeing them as kids, knowing the journey they’ll go on.”
“Do you resent me, for not taking that path?” A asked.  “Auditioning, all of that?”
“You saved lives.  You get to take a shortcut,” Amber replied.  “I’m not criticizing, for the record.  It’s important to have something.  Dreams, something to shoot for.  Something that takes work to keep.  It keeps us human.  That, sharing that, is a big part of what we give, I think.  There were times, years ago, that you said something along those lines, A.  Needing something to shoot for.”
“You’ve been looking that far back?”
“Yeah,” Amber said, with sincerity that made A pause.  “I’m trying to figure you out.  A lot of people are.”
Basil could feel as A’s skin prickled with goosebumps.  Basil suppressed most of it.
“Don’t be creeped out,” Amber said, taking note of what Basil was doing.
“I’m not, I’m- no.”
Jan straightened, stepping away from Amber.  “I see Arrow.  He’s apparently having a hard time with onboard-made changes to his body for a role.  I’m going to go say hi.  I like your thoughts, Amber.  Remembering the people who auditioned.  They weren’t necessarily worse, just less lucky.”
“I’d like to should do something.  Nag us, onboards?” Amber asked.  “It can be hard, when we’re as busy as we are.”
[Scheduled a nag,] Fly messaged.
[Oh, we can do that?] Basil asked.
“Within reason,” Amber said.
“We’ll do something, then,” Jan said, before stepping away, going down the short flight of stairs to where the junior Generation was.
Amber asked, “Do you want to walk and talk, see who else comes to pitch at us, or see what you’re about?  You can tell your friend to catch up later.”
Mechard was very much embroiled in discussion, now, surrounded by various fashion types and people who defined Belt culture.
Basil could feel A’s disappointment manifesting, the mixture of positive and negative chemical reactions with that note of stress.
[Dog?  Bring Mechard to us after?]
[ddo]
A laughed.
“You don’t laugh often,” Amber said.
“I like dog.  I like him more because Basil doesn’t seem to know what to do with him.”
“I’m not sure I’d want that having control over my body,” Amber said.  “No offense, dog.”
[noo]
“Mechard said dog stopped his heart once, so that’s a thing.”
“I’m more than happy with Fly.”
They ascended the stairs.  The upper level had a view of part of the lower level, past a stone railing, and a few groups had already congregated there.  A hubbub of conversation filled the space, high ceilings and stone walls giving things a quality that wasn’t found elsewhere.  Basil was unsure at the degree to which a human might notice.
Some people gave them space at the railing.  One of them glanced through A’s perspective, and paid momentary attention to the one point three billion who were watching.  More than a few minutes ago.
“It makes me think, though, do you think they’re going to allow Mechard to keep dog as-is?” Amber asked.  “Not because of safety, but, you know.  Public safety.  Getting everyone to help keep an eye on things.”
“He’s in the right place if he wants to find someone who could influence things.”
“But does that set a dangerous exception?” Amber asked.  “It would be unfair to not let others use something like dog, then, and that becomes a problem.”
“I don’t know,” A said.
[Your parents are trying to signal you.]
A nodded to herself, following Basil’s cue, meeting her father’s eyes.  He was on a lower level, just coming in the door.  She raised her hand.
“I’d hate to say goodbye to Fly.  She’s been with me all my life.”
“Maybe there’s a way to hybridize it?  Two onboards?” A asked.
“Messy, especially when one’s homemade,” Amber replied.  Basil could see Amber glancing through A’s history.  She’d studied A, apparently, so none of it would be news.  More of a cautious double-check.  “Your parents are very easygoing, compared to mine.”
Which prompted A to look through Amber’s history.
Twenty half-second clips of lectures, folded arms, Amber as a young child visibly frustrated while her mom loomed impassive, Amber on stage with her parents front row in the audience, paying close attention more than they were beaming and smiling.
“I’m not complaining about mine, to be clear,” Amber said.  “I told mine to be hard on me.”
Technically, her parents had asked Amber, at seven years of age, how badly she wanted to make it, and she’d been led to the point of saying, seriously, that she wanted to make it, and had asked her parents to be as hard on her as necessary to push her to get there.
A watched that clip, while Basil took note of the times Amber had hit her limit, and her parents had asked her if she needed to stop and walk away from this.  All before her acceptance into Generation Colors.
“They’re showing up?” A asked, even as she verified that they were.
Amber nodded, but she changed the subject, “do you want to go down and meet your parents, or-?”
“They’ll come up here.”
“While we’re here… those are some political types.”
“My parents were visiting with some of them the past few weeks.”
“Yeah.  Enjoying a nice night of music and performances.  Some in business.  Including our bosses, hosts of this event.”
Wan Graf was the only Elabre Systems CEO absent.
“It’s a game,” Amber said, quiet.  “The business, the politics.  Did you know that you decided the debate about the belt arrangement by accident?”
[Careful.  Touches on sensitive matters,] Fly noted.
“It’s okay,” A said.  “And yeah, Basil mentioned it.  I don’t know why they give me that much credit.”
“The way I look at it is… both answers were correct.  Hundreds of millions of experts who have spent their entire lives studying planetary movements, the Arcesso engines, geology, superstructure architecture, all of that, all worked on things.  If one of them, one genius, one person working hard, could find a flaw or danger or anything serious, that would make their careers.”
A nodded.
“There was no actual wrong answer.  No answer that kills people or ruins things.  Just answers that earn some businesses more, or give certain people who bet on the right horse more of an edge, politically.  And the business stuff, again, even if it goes terribly wrong…”
“No consequence?” A asked.
“Very very few, anyway.  To the point where it’s… almost for fun.  A game, like I said.  Lux can be inflated or deflated as required, to support that game, a lot of people here manage the game, instead of playing it.  Worst case scenario, if people bet everything, they still have food, and safety.  The only actual consequences would be the very edge cases.  See that group down there?”
They were people who looked modded, and had tubes running into a single nostril, each.  Their skin didn’t have pores, and their bodies were smaller, and denser.
“Yeah.  No onboards.  Weird.”
“Neptunians, they-”
“Ahh.”
“–Yeah.  Not actually from Neptune, and the project doesn’t have anything to do with Neptune, but the project name got turned around, and it’s what everyone calls them.”
“Never seen them before, have I, Basil?”
[No.]
“It’s one of their first times out in public.  They’re trying to do a promotional tour.  Putting a gene-modified face to the project name.  Which means…”
Amber craned her head.
[Here.]
Fly supplied the shots from other people’s onboards, helping Amber’s eyes find the people.  She indicated them, while Basil helped.
They were people, with hair shorn short, and noticeable scars.  Some of the onboarding that was normally subdermal extended to the superdermal, especially around scar tissue and eyes.  It looked like they had eyelashes made of the sort of clumped up iron filings that one got using magnets.
“There.  U.N.I. group.  They’re the competitors.  The Neptunian Mission is using liquid oxygen lungs and heavy gene modding, experimental Spallanzi-style cell and DNA protection, and a stalled metabolism rest relay to get out into deep space.  U.N.I. group is after the same mission, but they aren’t doing pseudostasis.  Both with Arcesso-assisted launches.”
“I admire it.  Taking that time, modifying their bodies-”
“Or brains,” Amber said. “U.N.I. group has Intelligence-emulated humanity.  Chips instead of gray matter.  They’re staying awake the entire trip.”
[Brains and bodies, in that case.]
[It’s really art, from an objective standpoint.  Both are.]
“True,” Amber said.  “Both of you are right.  But yeah.  I thought you’d admire it, based on what you’ve said in the past.”
“That’s what it’s about,” A said.
“Use of the Arcesso engine is limited, I think they’ll probably both get a shot, but in case they don’t, there’s a lot of… this.  Being where the big names are, self-promoting.  Or hoping they get a shot first.  Because obviously, being the first to arrive is a big deal, and a couple years head start on a trip that might take four hundred years even with the boost would help.”
“I bet there’s a lot of pushing to get their engines to be the very best they can be.”
“Has to be reliable, more than anything, though.”
“What are you girls talking about?” Landon Teeg asked, as he came up the stairs closest to them.  “All these big names around, and you’re talking about space travel?”
“Hello, Mr. Teeg,” Amber said, straightening from where she’d bent over the railing.
He approached and hugged A.  Addy, delayed because she was half-turned, talking to someone who was standing on the landing midway up the stairs, joined in late.
Both Landon and Addy Teeg had onboards now, of course, following the law.  Like many grown adults, they had onboards that came with preset personalities, instead of personalities that had adjusted and grown as the individuals grew up.  A little stiff, but very capable.
“I’m sorry we were away.  A lot of people were upset with that,” Landon said.
“It’s okay, you explained it,” A said.
“We’re trying to get to grips with the sorts of deals people want to make with you, so we can be a bit of a filter, freeing you to do the sorts of things you want to do,” Landon said.
“The problem is, neither of you have much more experience than me.”
“But we are adults,” Addy said, giving A a kiss on the top of the head.
“Four brains are better than two,” Amber said.
A’s mother explained, “There was a lot of discussion about the politics of things.  It’s easy to say that one thing or another is a good idea, but there usually knock-on effects from a policy change.  You have to consider who your neighbors are, the effect of those changes on them, the businesses impacted.”
“I can’t focus on all those details,” A said.
“It can be important, or at least keeping a few in mind,” her mother replied, “The effects are pretty major.”
“If I can interject,” Amber said.
“Of course,” Landon replied, but it was a guarded reply.  He was nervous, on multiple levels.
“A might be very, very close to being in a position where she can do no wrong in the public’s eyes.”
“I don’t know about that,” A replied.
“I don’t know either.  Anyway, the idea is that you can run some ideas past us, if you need to,” Landon said.  “Avoid any bad blood.”
Landon and Addy Teeg were afraid.  They’d been lambasted and, in one case, even approached by groups of A’s wider audience, for failing in their duties as parents, and now they were struggling to do damage control, appearing here, acting fond of A, and justifying their approach.
Amber had her graces, and knew a lot, but she might not have understood that her clarifications worked against that justification.
“I can count on one hand the people that got popular enough that they could influence one political point like that, in their careers,” Amber observed.  “You could affect multiple.  Mr. Brothers was saying you could impact culture multiple times over, redefine the media landscape.”
Basil followed as the conversation continued, with Addy explaining more of the political back and forth.  He threw in a:
[Be careful, some of the voices teaching them have their own biases.]
“Obviously,” was the response.
In the background, other things were happening.  Her discussion of the Neptunian mission compared to the U.N.I. Group was being picked apart for word choice, and was shifting public favor enough that both groups were stopping what they were doing and having huddled talks.
The ripple effects of that were that many people were hypersensitive to the idea they might be trying to influence A on levels they didn’t intend.  One man was having an entire department run through word choices for talking about planetary science and nature.  The plan had been to bring up Quinn.
Past that… safety concerns.  The judiciary blocked public access to their onboards when on duty, so the activities of the Tenures was changing, but Basil could analyze how various members of security in the building were acting, and how people were being subtly ushered inside.  It could be explained away as the show starting soon, but that wasn’t it.
Basil began assessing the escape routes and possibilities.
“Something’s up,” A murmured, quiet, interrupting Landon Teeg.
She’d noticed later than Basil and some other onboards, but sooner than most.
[Security is guiding people indoors.]
“What?” Amber asked.
“Basil, do what you need to do, for a worst case scenario?”
People throughout the building were noticing because A had noticed.
[Slowing digestion, vasoconstriction underway, nanotech laddering in musculature for added strength, skin durability…]
“You don’t need to report it.  Thank you.”
“I swear, if you put me to sleep this time…”
[I won’t.  Even if I thought it prudent, you are in charge of me, instead of your parents.]
Basil worked, preparing the other countermeasures.  Counter nanotech only made sense, considering, and he could work faster in any direction, if needed.  Chemical countermeasures were more interesting, and he didn’t want to make A look strange by coating the skin in some of the countermeasures, so he kept things locked and loaded in the metaphorical chamber.  Pores, in this case, with cylindrical nanotech arrangements and surface tension keeping the chemicals within.
He had to adjust, fast, as Amber reached out to touch A’s arm.  It would have been easy for that contact to disturb that surface tension and release foaming chemical around and under the points of contact.
A’s heartbeats came very slow, as Basil worked, but blood rushed anyway, pumped by his coordinated systems.
“Ahem,” a man said.  He owned the Teatro Colón, or Columbus Theatre in conventional usage, and was taking a position of authority, consulting with the local Judiciary.  “Everyone, please remain calm.  We have no reason to think this is a serious incident.  Security lines were breached, we ask everyone to stay away from the windows and to make room for any movements by the security teams.”
In the midst of everything, Basil was keenly aware of A’s stress.  He could recognize the imminent physical symptoms, and counter them, but he couldn’t do much about the mental.  Her eyes moved over everything, and by how much they were dilating, she wasn’t seeing much.
[A,] Basil told her.  He needed to ground her.  [I’m here to assist and enable you.  Things do not seem as dire as they did at the science center.]
“Don’t talk to me about the science center.”
[Guns aren’t raised or drawn, movements seem relatively relaxed.]
“People were relaxed before the first shots of those nanotech weapons.”
[People are more aware and alert in general.]
“It’s the crowd,” Amber said.
Basil checked what Amber was looking at.  She was following some of the channels that discussed and followed A, and from there, Basil could map out some of the people who’d come as close to A as they could get, gathering as a crowd at the edges of this block, where the judiciary and Tenures were lined up to bar the way.
People had penetrated security.  A Tenure flew over the crowd to drop a rain of stun charges on the crowd.  The expectation seemed to be that people would be stunned, left reeling, and the momentum would be broken.
Instead, people who were stunned enough to stumble or fall were trampled by those who came after.
[Address them collectively.  Virtually all of them are following you.]
“You’re hurting people,” A said, to open air.  They still stood at the railing where stairwells on either side met.  It gave them a view overlooking the entrance.  “Stop, pick up the people who fell, listen to the security teams.”
Some stopped, like they’d been slapped in the face.
A surprising number didn’t.
“They’re upset,” Amber said.  “That this event is exclusive.  There is a group of your followers who attended and are waiting patiently for a moment to see you, I’ve been told to remind you to visit them later.”
“I wouldn’t forget,” A murmured.
“No.  Of course.  But that cost them a lot of lux.  People who couldn’t dream of paying are very vocal on the Belt network about the unfairness.  You’re performing later?”
“We’ll see.  Possibly at the very end of things, but I wasn’t getting the vocal ranges perfect in practice,” A said.  Her voice was terse, in large part because of the battle readiness Basil had implemented.
“They’re saying it’s unfair people here who aren’t fans might get to listen to you, and actual fans are left out.”
Fly supplied a smattering of images, almost exactly as the sounds reached them.  People had reached the outside of the Theatre.
They had enough grace to not break the windows, but security had their hands full.
Wan Graf, one of the CEOs of Elabre Systems, was messaging Amber.
Telling her to stop commenting.  It could be construed as giving a voice to the troublemakers, and it was agitating the people in the crowd who were now more worried they’d be attacked, after hearing that.
Commentary in general stopped.  People stood back and out of the way, and a few people in security uniforms ran through the crowds to set up nearer to windows at one side of the building.
Seven people in the crowd had weapons, according to the accumulated eyewitness sightings and analysis of various intelligences, many of them onboards.  Two of those people, who had no onboard yet, had been observed buying and acquiring the things that could be used to make weapons.
Four had been arrested.
A fifth was specifically targeted as Basil was in the midst of drawing out a map, in case it was needed.  A spotlight-like beam was focused on the crowd, sonic rather than light, and a team of people dropped down from the Tenure to surround the fifth person.  Their uniforms protected them from the wavelength-induced vertigo, and they were able to get the man’s hands behind his back, tied, and remove the homemade gun from his things.
The sixth and seventh were arrested in tandem a moment later.  Both were bent over, moving through the sub-floor between the levels of the superstructure.  One got a single shot off of her weapon.
Breach.  Another onboard present could read the word on the lips of a security team member who had his hand up to cover his face… not quite covered from every angle.
Cameras and onboards provided a view.
A’s onboard gave the offending group a clear idea of where in the building she was.  They were coming here.
[Be ready.]
“I can’t do this.”
[You’re fine.  Stand tall, be firm.]
“You’re fucking me up, suppressing me.  Not letting me feel what I need to feel.”
[I’m keeping you upright, heartrate and breathing at acceptable levels, so you can continue to be the you that you were in the science center.]
“Scared?  Fucked up?  Put to sleep because you didn’t trust me to handle anything?”
[The vast majority of the belt watched the footage where you held your own and strategized.  I’m keeping you focused enough in body that you can keep being that, without betraying that.  You decide what to do.]
A clenched her fists.
Security, heavily uniformed, wearing helmets, carrying prods, intercepted the incoming group.  The incoming people were disorganized, and in that initial clash, one uniform in security was capable of dealing with three people.
But the general rule was that it took three people to keep one restrained.  Armor, shields, and the electric prods gave an initial advantage, and put a few people down hard enough that they didn’t get back up.
And, besides, there were more than three people for every one in the security team.
Some slipped past the wall of shields.
People from the crowd stepped forward, to put themselves in the way, this time.  All dressed for a nice evening out.  Landon Teeg was one.
Barring the way.
“A!” a young woman shouted.  Hruby Goldcliff.  She’d dressed nice, and had used her recently acquired onboard to extend her hair, like A’s.  Skin and hair lightened, to match.  Clothing white, though it was pants and a shirt, instead of a dress.  Her onboard was very similar to Landon Teeg’s.  “I’ve been watching you for the last three months, twenty-four seven!  I got modded to access the roof.  Devotion should be rewarded, not lux!”
“Stop,” A said.
“I love you!” Hruby shouted.
“Stop!” A raised her voice.  Basil wasn’t able to pivot in time for the shift in emotion.  There was a catch in the word.
Hruby stopped struggling.  Two people in evening wear grabbed her.
“Stop,” A told them, too.
They stopped, but kept a grip on the woman’s sleeves.
“Can we talk?” a man asked.  He had a square jaw, a thick beard, brown, and parted hair, the same.  Slashes of blue eyeshadow marked his lower eyelids, evoking the same color as his eyes.
[Robert Simes.  Politician.  Controls a lot of territory on Earth.]
More messages were coming in.
“Mr. Simes.”
“Call me Robert.  Can we talk about responses?”
[Wan Graf Elabre wants to talk to you too.  Haveman is coming too.]
“Okay,” A said.
She held up a hand, flat, to tell others to stop.
“Come?” she asked Amber.
“I’m nobody, compared to-”
“I trust you.”
Amber nodded.
They formed a huddle, with Wan Graf connected via. onboards.  Haveman used his onboard to project an image of Wan Graf as if the man were present, so Basil did the same.
“We should move carefully,” Robert said.
“I’m not so big that I can do no wrong, then, still?” A asked.
“Not quite,” Haveman said.
“Any action we take has ramifications,” Wan Graf said.  “If she welcomes this audience, it encourages more of the same.  Any action we take to punish this runs the risk of becoming symbolic.  People would happily martyr themselves for a moment of attention from someone they look up to, like they look up at A.”
“They fully intend to be martyrs,” Haveman said.  “There are already discussions about imprisonment, fines, and community service, larger numbers would be bigger signs of devotion to their idol.  They would go further, to surpass one another.”
“Is the best thing to do for A to ignore this?  Step back and step down?” Amber asked.
“Possibly.”
[Amber’s hands are shaking.]
A reached out, holding Amber’s hand.  “You okay?”
Amber nodded.  “I only saw- from afar.  Recordings.  I don’t know how you’re holding it together.”
A gave Amber’s hand a light squeeze.
“I cautiously submit that admitting to being upset would only agitate the worst elements in all of this.  It’s good you’re calm,” Haveman told A.
“Can’t accept them, can’t punish them too harshly, can’t condemn them, can’t appeal to them on an emotional level to say how upsetting this is- not that you are.”
“I’m okay,” A said, quiet.
“Insufficient action means this might happen again,” Robert commented.  He hadn’t said a lot, despite organizing this huddle.
“We’ll have more security next time,” Haveman said.
“Nonetheless.”
“Would it take the fire out of the moment, if we carried on with the evening?  Let the judiciary handle things?” Amber asked.
“I’m not sure the crowd outside would settle,” Wan Graf replied.
“I can do no wrong?”
[Not exactly what she said.]
“This huddle isn’t accomplishing anything, and they’re listening in.”
[I know.  At least tell me what you’re thinking?  Two brains are better than one.]
“Sometimes I need to be one brain, Basilisk.”
A let go of Amber’s hand, then turned her head.
That small motion interrupted Wan Graf as he started to say, “We should-”
There was a pause.  A had met Hruby’s eyes.
“I’ll handle it,” A said.
“Are you-” “It might be better-”
Voices overlapped.
But A stepped away from the huddle.
“You changed my life,” Hruby said.  “I know this is extreme, but you’re extreme, and we all need to push harder, for our opportunities.  You taught me that.  So I pushed.  I set a goal, you, and went for it.  It feels like I’m living for the first time.  I wanted you to know that.”
“Basil?” A asked.  “Filter out anything this person says.  I want to hear other noises as if she hadn’t spoken at all.”
[I can do that.]
Basil set to work.
“Visually, too.  No logs, no messages.”
Hruby’s lips moved.  Basil filtered out the sound.
Then Hruby was erased, a projection of the background in each of A’s eyes, keyed to the background, seamless.
“Basil, can we get a restraining order?  I don’t want this person attending or anywhere near any of my events.  This kind of thing makes people feel unsafe.”
“I can help with that,” Robert said.  “You might have to run it by any new jurisdiction you enter.”
“We can make it a prerequisite of any contract or performance where Generation Colors is involved,” Wan Graf said.
A nodded.  “Belt Network too?  The groups they’re communicating with?”
“We can work something out.  No tickets sold to those who associate with offenders,” Wan Graf said.  “Including on the Belt Network.”
“I don’t want ads about me shown to them, they don’t see me, hear me, I don’t see or hear them.  In person, in ads, in media, in other people’s onboards, any of that.  Nothing they could use to figure out anything about me, where I am, where I’ve been, what I’m doing.”
“That can be made a part of the restraining order,” Robert said.
“For this person, and everyone else that came inside?  Short version of the same deal for those who breached security lines?” A asked.
“It could be done,” Robert said.  “My people are discussing it.”
“The attack on the science center made a lot of people feel unsafe, and like they didn’t have a say over their own fates,” A said.  “If my audience is out of control, that’s not that different.  So… not my audience, anymore.”
“Anything else?” Robert asked.
“The judiciary can decide the rest.  I don’t want to know.”
The security officers turned.  Hruby didn’t fight them, she was so shocked.  Basil used projections to paint the scene as if they were walking away, casually, arms empty, weapons put away.
Amber approached, but kept a small distance between herself and A.
“Did I screw up so badly that they all hate me now?” A asked.
[It doesn’t seem so.]
Amber frowned.
If anything, the way people were reacting to and coloring the harshness and lack of sympathy suggested Amber was closer to right.  Or, perhaps more accurately, A had moved closer to the ‘can do no wrong’ than she’d been, before this.
“Deftly handled, I think,” Haveman said.  As the ‘face’ of Elabre systems, he seemed to handle a lot of the PR, presentations, and meetings.  He seemed pleased- or as pleased as he got.  He was a very serious man, though not grim, per se.  It conveyed confident energy.
“Do you think you’ll perform tonight?” Wan Graf asked.  “The new songs?”
“Yes,” A replied.
It had been a ‘maybe’, earlier.
“There will be a short opera, an intermission, a series of performances, of which you’ll be last, you can enjoy the first half, then use the time between the intermission and your performance to get sorted,” Wan Graf told her.  “I’ll let the others know they’re on instruments.”
“Thank you,” A said.
“We’ll have to be mindful of security,” Wan Graf said.  “We don’t want this to mean more security risk.”
Making possible threats invisible to A was a danger.
[I’ll keep an eye out.]
“Anything else?”
“No, I don’t think so,” A said.
“Then I’ll leave you to your evening.”
Wan Graf exited the conversation.  Basil stopped projecting the man’s image.
“And our star of the evening remains very hard to predict,” Robert said.
Some of Robert’s friends that he had been talking to earlier came over.
“It’s not the goal.  The unpredictability happens on its own.”
“I’ve been following your conversations since you entered the building,” one of the men said.  “Very interesting.  I admit, and don’t think less of me, I was hoping to hear your parents expound on the nuances of politics.  One act… how many ripples?”
“Is this an act?” Amber asked.  “Dealing with the protest in this way?”
“Isn’t it?  Everything A does is an act.”
[By definition.]
“And by how we measure power, onboard,” the man said.  “Every word, word choice, action, it’s as good as legislation.”
“The reason we’re interested,” Robert said, “Is that by Amber’s definition, we’re among those who make the rules for the games that others play, in markets, business, research, trying to be first.  Elabre may be a top player now, but we… organize the game, set up the playing field, decide the rules.”
[Robert chief among these rule-makers.]
“And so do you,” Robert said.  “A lot of people are interested in how you’ll shake things up.  Like you did with the Belt network.  Like you did just now.”
“Are some upset?” A asked.
Robert smiled.  “Less than you’d think.  It’s like you and Amber have said.  People need something to strive for.  If it was as simple as judging the numbers and taking the boring path, it wouldn’t matter.  It has to be interesting, engaging, and feed that human need for something to strive for.  That’s what we provide.  Successful people are those who can to read the direction of the wind, respond quickly to complicated forces.”
“Or be quick to act, as Mr. Conaway Brothers was,” another man said.
“All I really want is to make music, act, make my audience happy.  Not…” A struggled to find words.
“Absolutely.  And you should.  Forgive us if we jump at the chance to play what we normally arbitrate.  When you act, the earth literally moves, and we’ll bet on the outcomes.”
Literally moving.  He was referring to the big debate over the belt arrangement.
One of Robert’s friends said, “I’d be interested in sponsoring Mr. Brother’s Coordinated Canon.  Since you appear to be comfortable in the company of Amber, here, we can make her involvement a stipulation.”
“Oh, that’s not why I’m-” Amber started.
“Even so.”
“Maybe,” A said.
“To one up my friend here,” one of the other men said.
“Are we competing?” the first man asked.  “I didn’t know we were competing.”
“Maybe we are, maybe we aren’t, but I thought I’d say, I know people who control tracts of proper nature.  I know your childhood friend has an attachment to that.  Would you be interested in having a corner of your own?  Perhaps that would give you two a space, away from all of this?”
“I-” A started.
She looked for Mechard and spotted him.  He’d broken away from the group he’d been in before, but wasn’t approaching.  Some people had engaged him in conversation, and he politely maintained it.
“Think about it.”
“I will,” A replied.
“Let’s not bombard her, though,” the first man said.
“I won’t bombard, but I won’t stand back either,” Robert said.  “Would you permit me a chance to get your attention, A?  Before things start and we take our seats?”
“Yeah.  That’s fine?”
“Back in the day, you ran away, then jumped off of the side of the block.”
“Hurt my friend.  Yes.  It was reckless.”
“It was interesting.  Riveting, really, because in the questioning that followed, it came out that you used some secret codes to communicate with your onboard, and with your friend.  Looking at something of a particular color at a key moment.”
“Yes,” A said.
“So tell me if I got this right?” he asked.  “Pardon me.”
He leaned in close, hand at A’s back.  Then he paused.
She frowned slightly.
“Have to make sure I say this right.”
“What are you up to, Robert?” the first of his friends asked.
“Arrow, circle, white, circle, circle?” he asked.
Complete nonsense.
But…
“If A is the heroine, and Basil the Charlatan, then what am I?”
The words felt very loud and solid, transmitted within the back channel.
A’s entire body reacted to the… intrusion?  Tense in a different way than it had been when people had breached security.
There were enough people paying attention to the conversation, following everything about this exchange, except for the fact that they were ignorant about the back channel.
Not quite an intrusion.  A meeting at the wall.  He’d placed his hand in the right spot, and nanotech at the fingers was transmitting to the sensors within the body.
[A friend,] Basil said, on the main channel.  The man hadn’t outed them.
“I don’t know,” A replied.  “Dangerous?”
Robert straightened, smiling.  “Let’s go with the first.”
Basil was busy trying to scan all past interactions, everything Robert had done, who he’d met.
If there was a chance Elabre Systems knew, then… no, Robert hadn’t had much contact with them.  Nothing that could be coded.
How did he know?
“You use codes?” Amber asked.  “I knew about the mauve code.”
“It’s a way to have privacy,” Robert said.  “It makes sense.  But for most people… it won’t work.  Intelligences look out for that sort of thing.  You have to live it, like A has.”
“You have layered codes that hold up even now, that you made when you were little?” Amber asked.  “That you’ve lived and made enough a part of your routine, that people don’t notice?  Except for Robert?”
“No comment,” A said, quiet.
“I don’t know whether to be intimidated, or to be glad you kind of auditioned in your own way.”
“Basil may be just as impressive as A is,” Robert said.
“You win,” A told him.  Her hackles were up now.  Maybe because of that last statement.
“Do I?”
“Out of your friends.  You got my attention.  Can you stop putting me on the spot, at least?”
Robert threw up his hands, as if in surrender.
“We’ll talk,” A said, seriously.
The man smiled.  “Of course.”
Billions of people had been tipped off, now.  That a code existed.  Many busied themselves poring over A’s past, looking at what Robert had looked at.  Some of the footage they studied was footage Basil had fabricated, and changed.
That included the jump off the side of the block.  Basil had made it more A’s idea.
Dangerous.  This was dangerous.
➨
Dangerous.
A dozed.
The worlds kept turning.  Worlds arranged as they had been for now, but they’d be rearranged in coming years, and as people had pointed out, A had decided that arrangement, by accident.
Other things happened by accident as well.  Fallout.  Disaster.
It said a lot that A had played three new songs for the Belt to hear, or Basil had, at least, and the stress and anxiety of that, or the massive, positive response weren’t even top of mind.
Mechard had disconnected dog while making changes.  He’d reconnect the onboard later, but for now, he needed to shut people out.  He’d come to be a support for A and had inadvertently abandoned her.  The masses were furious, and made themselves more angry by talking about it in channels where people only amped each other up.
A group of sixteen had arrived at Mechard’s door to try to get inside and confront him.  Authorities had intervened.  Mechard had been moved from his home to places unknown.
Landon and Addy Teeg faced something similar, if milder.  Their messaging, about wanting to help, had worked enough that it put a speed bump in amid the furor.  Some of that fury was spent on debate.
Robert had been interesting, and had piqued interest, so now people were treating A like a puzzle to be solved.  Basil was getting far more interest as an individual than before, as a result.
Not ideal.
But, more than anything, Hruby Goldcliff, who had had the misfortune of being the one individual out of the whole mob of people who had broken past security and made it inside the Theatre, closest to A, had been attacked and killed by members of A’s audience.  The Judiciary had acted, people had been arrested.
Collateral damage.
The audience was still deciding about Amber.  On a level, it seemed like they wanted to be upset.
A turned over, uneasy.  She was dozy enough that she didn’t seem to remember the room, even though she’d been here on Elabre’s grounds for three months, now.
[A.  Message Amber?]
“Why?”
[If you say something kind, the audience will leave her be.  A kind word would help you keep a friend.]
“Do I even have friends anymore?” A asked.
Was she thinking about Mechard?
Basil was processing that, and trying to weigh what she might be reading into Amber, or Robert, or other members of Generation Color, that Basil wasn’t, when she interrupted.
“Amber,” A said, flopping over onto her back.  “Basil, be prepared to message her this.  Text.  For Amber.”
[I can do that.]
“Amber, thank you for being a friend.  It meant a lot tonight. It would be easy for you to fall into the role of rival, or to resent me, for intruding.  I know I haven’t earned my stripes yet, but I’m really glad you weren’t.”
[That will do.]
“As a foremost expert on stripes,” Amber messaged back.  She took a second to have Fly paint over her face and body, so she was orange, like her Generation Colors color, with stripes, like a tiger, “You’re fine.  You earned your stripes.  Stop worrying about that.  Thank you for inviting me to the huddle.”
They left it at that.
A was too sleepy to note what had happened with Mechard.  That would be a conversation for tomorrow.
The death?  Hard to say.  It would be better to leave that to others, like Elabre’s CEOs.  The death brought back very similar dilemmas to the ones they’d discussed in the huddle, before A had frozen Hruby out.
“We might have to kill Robert.”
Basil was silent, in response, to that message that A subvocalized for the back channel.
A sighed, shifting in bed to get more comfortable.  But it was clear, with the context of that subvocalized message, why she was restless.  Why she stared up at the ceiling.
[That would be illegal, by Belt Law, which I am beholden to.]
“Fucking figure it out, Basilisk.  Handle it by back channel alone.  Find a justification.  You were able to do that when putting me to sleep in the science center.  I don’t want to, the idea terrifies me, but…”
She didn’t finish the statement.
Basil considered for a long moment.
[I’ll figure something else out.]
